# Co2 emission Prediction using Linear regression

Here we'll create a model using Logistic regression, to predict Co2 emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

**Data Source**-https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/

**Tools used**- Jupyter notebook 

**Language and Packages uesd**- Python (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Sklearn)

## Data Cleaning
The data is imported and checked troughly for any irregularities and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration .

## Linear regression Model
The data is preprocessed to form a test,train split which is then used to create the model.

The model is then evaluated which has an **average accuracy of 87%**.

The model is also used to predict Co2 emission of a imaginary car A.
