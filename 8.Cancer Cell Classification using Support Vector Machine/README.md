# Cancer Cell Classification using Support Vector Machine
We will use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

**Data Source**- http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html%5D

**Tools used**- Jupyter notebook 

**Language and Packages uesd**- Python (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Sklearn)

## Data Cleaning
The data is imported and checked troughly for any irregularities and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration .

## SVM Model
The data is preprocessed to form a test,train split which is then used to create the model.

The model is then evaluated which has an **average accuracy of 96%**.

The model is also used to predict whether an imaginary customer A is benign or malignant.
