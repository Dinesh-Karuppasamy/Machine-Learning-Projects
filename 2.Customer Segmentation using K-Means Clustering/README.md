# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Here we'll create a model for Customer segmentation which is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources.

**Tools used**- Jupyter notebook 

**Language and Packages uesd**- Python (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Sklearn)

## Data Cleaning
The data is imported and checked troughly for any irregularities and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration .

## Data Exploration 
The data is explored to find relationships and insights present.

**Key Findings:**

1.Average age of the customer is 35.

2.Average years employed of the customer is 8.5 years.

3.Average income of the customer is 47 units.

4.Maximum number of cutomers defualted in debt repayment.

5.Average Customer defaulted more on other debts than card debt.

6.Debt-income ratio of a average customer is 10.17 .

## K-Means Clustering Model
The data is preprocessed to create the model.

K-means partitioned the customers into mutually exclusive groups of,

1.AFFLUENT, EDUCATED AND OLD AGED 

2.MIDDLE AGED AND MIDDLE INCOME 

3.YOUNG AND LOW INCOME
