# Customer Segmentation using K-Nearest Neighbors

A telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers.

**Tools used**- Jupyter notebook 

**Language and Packages uesd**- Python (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Sklearn)

## Data Cleaning
The data is imported and checked troughly for any irregularities and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration .

## Data Exploration 
The data is explored to find relationships and insights present.

**Key Findings:**

1.Average age of our customer is approximately 42. 

2.Average income is close to 78 units.

3.Half of the customers are Single.

4.Plus service has most number of subscribers followed by Basic service,Total service and E-service.

##  K-Nearest Neighbors Model
The data is preprocessed to form a test,train split which is then used to create the model.

The model is then evaluated which has an best accuracy of 34%.

The model is also used to predict which service an imaginary customer A will subscribe to.
