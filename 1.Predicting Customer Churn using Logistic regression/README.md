# Predicting Customer Churn using Logistic regression
Here we'll create a model for a telecommunication company using Logistic regression, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.

**Tools used**- Jupyter notebook 

**Language and Packages uesd**- Python (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Sklearn)

## Data Cleaning
The data is imported and checked troughly for any irregularities and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration .

## Data Exploration 
The data is explored to find relationships and insights present.

**Key Findings:**

1.Most of the customers are young (18-38) followed by middle aged (38-57) and elderly (57-76).

2.More than quarter (29.5%) of the companys customers are from last 19 years.

3.Average income of the customer is 75 units.

4.Average age of the customer is 41

## Logistic regression Model
The data is preprocessed to form a test,train split which is then used to create the model.

The model is then evaluated which has an **average accuracy of 72%**.

The model is also used to predict whether an imaginary customer A will churn or not.
