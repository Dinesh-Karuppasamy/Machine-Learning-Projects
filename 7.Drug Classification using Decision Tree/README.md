# Drug Classification using Decision Tree
The dataset has data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and Drug y.

Now, we are going to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.

**Tools used**- Jupyter notebook 

**Language and Packages uesd**- Python (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Sklearn)

## Data Cleaning
The data is imported and checked troughly for any irregularities and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration .

## Data Exploration 
The data is explored to find relationships and insights present.

**Key Findings:**

1.Average age of the patient is 44.

2.Average Sodium Potassium level is 16 units.

3.Most of the patients has high BP and Cholestrol.

4.The patients are of approximately equal in sex ratio.

5.Most of the patients responded to Drug Y.

## Decision Tree Model
The data is preprocessed to form a test,train split which is then used to create the model.

The model is then evaluated which has an **average accuracy of 98%**.

The model is also used to predict which drug might be appropriate for an imaginary patient A.
